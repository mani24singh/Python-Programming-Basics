# Library-Management-System :
Implemented a Student Library system using OOPs where a student can borrow book from the list of shown books. And also return the book back to the library after use. Here, We have created two separate class as Library and other as student. Our program is menu-driven using while loop. And we have used various attributes and methods like borrow, add/return, request to improve functionality of our program.

To use this program in your OS. follow the following steps :
1. Add the .py file in machine and open it in your IDE.
2. Press Run command and select the desired option from the menu.
       for example. if you select option 1 => this will display all the names of the books available.
3. select the option 2 to request a book and enter the name of the book.
4. Press option 3 to return a book and option 4 to exit the LMS.
