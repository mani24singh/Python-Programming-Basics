# Conditional Expressions :
- In python programming too, we must be able to execute instructions on a condition(s) being met. This is what conditions are used for.
- If else and elif in Python : If else and elif statements are a multiway decision taken by our program due to certain conditions in our code.
- Relational Operators : Relational operators are used to evaluate conditions inside if statements. Some examples of relational operators are:
   1. ( == )-> equals
   2. ( >= )-> greater than/equal to
   3. ( <= )-> less than/equal to
- Logical Operators : In python, logical operators operate on conditional statements. Example:
   1. and -> true if both operands are true else false
   2. or -> true if at least one operand is true else false
   3. not -> inverts true to false and false to true
- elif clause : elif in python means [else if]. If statement can be chained together with a lot of these elif statements followed by an else statement.
- The above ladder will stop once a condition in an if or elif is met.
- Important Notes:
   - There can be any number of elif statements.
   - Last else is executed only if all the conditions inside elifs fail.
