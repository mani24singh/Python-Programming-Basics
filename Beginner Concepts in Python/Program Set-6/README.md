# Loops in Python :
- Sometimes we want to repeat a set of statements in our program. For instance: Print 1 to 1000
- Loops make it easy for a programmer to tell the computer, which set of instructions to repeat, and how.
- Types of loops in Python : Primarily there are two types of loops in Python
   1. While loop
   2. For loop

## While loop :
- In while loops, the condition is checked first. If it evaluates to true, the body of the loop is executed, otherwise not.
- The block keeps executing until the condition is true/false.
- If the loop is entered, the process of condition check and execution is continued until the condition becomes false.
- Note: if the condition never becomes false, the loop keeps getting executed.

## For loop :
- A for loop is used to iterate through a sequence like a list, tuple, or string (iterables)

## Range function in Python :
- The range function in python is used to generate a sequence of numbers.
- We can also specify the start, stop, and step-size as follows: range(start, stop, step_size)
   - Note : step size is usually not used with range()

## The break statement :
- ‘break’ is used to come out of the loop when encountered. It instructs the program to – Exit the loop now.

## The continue statement :
- ‘continue’ is used to stop the current iteration of the loop and continue with the next one. It instructs the program to “skip this iteration.”
 
## pass statement :
- Pass is a null statement in python. It instructs to “Do nothing.”
