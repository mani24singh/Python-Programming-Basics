# Python-Basics-Beginners
## Print function :
- print(“Hello World”)         # print is a inbuilt python function to print required
   - Execute this file (.py file) by typing python hello.py, and you will see Hello World printed on the screen.

## Modules, Comments & Pip :
- Modules : A module is a file containing code written by somebody else (usually) which can be imported and used in our programs.
- Pip :Pip is a package manager for python. You can use pip to install a module on your system. \
E.g., pip install flask (It will install flask module in your system)
- Types of modulesm : There are two types of modules in Python:
   1. Built-in modules – Pre-installed in Python. Some examples of built-in modules are os, abc, etc.
   2. External modules – Need to install using pip. Some examples of external modules are TensorFlow, flask, etc.
- Using Python as a Calculator : We can use python as a calculator by typing “python” + TO DO on the terminal. [It opens REPL or read evaluation print loop]
- Comments: Comments are used to write something which the programmer does not want to execute. Comments can be used to mark the author's name, date, etc.
- Types of Comments: There are two types of comments in python,
   1. Single line comments – Written using # (pound/hash symbol)
   2. Multi-line comments – Written using ‘’’ Comment ‘’’ or “”” Comment “””.




Chapter 2 – Variables and Data Types
A variable is a name given to a memory location in a program. For example

a=30

b=”Harry”

c=71.22
Variable – Container to store a value

Keywords – Reserved words in Python

Identifiers – class/function/variable name

Data Types:
Primarily there are the following data types in Python:

Integers
Floating point numbers
Strings
Booleans
None
Python is a fantastic language that automatically identifies the type of data for us.

a = 71                                    #Identifies a as class<int>

b = 88.44                              #Identifies b as class<float>

name = “Harry”                  #Identifies name as class<Str>
Rules for defining a variable name: (Also applicable to other identifiers)

A variable name can contain alphabets, digits, and underscore.
A variable name can only start with an alphabet and underscore.
A variable can’t start with a digit.
No white space is allowed to be used inside a variable name.
Examples of few valid variable names,

Harry, harry, one8, _akki, aakash, harry_bro, etc.
