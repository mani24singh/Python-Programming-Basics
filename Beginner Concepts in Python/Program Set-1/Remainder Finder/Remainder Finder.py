# Program to find a Remainder when Dividend is Divided by a Divisor as Given by User

# Assigning input Variables
x = input("Enter the Dividend Number : ")
x = int(x)
y = input("Enter the Divisor Number : ")
y = int(y)

# Creating the remainder finder function
rem = (x%y)

print("The Remainder of the given inputs is :", rem)
